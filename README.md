# Bash Programming on HackerRank

![HackerRank Logo](https://hrcdn.net/community-frontend/assets/brand/logo-new-white-green-a5cb7f2f.svg)

This repository showcases my solutions to various problem statements on HackerRank using the Bash programming language. I have taken up different challenges and demonstrated my problem-solving skills in Bash scripting. Each solution provided here has passed the test cases on HackerRank, and I have optimized them to achieve efficient and accurate results.

## Introduction

[Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) is a popular Unix shell and command language, which is widely used in Linux and macOS environments. It provides a powerful scripting environment to automate tasks and perform various operations on the command line. By participating in HackerRank challenges, I have honed my skills in Bash programming and improved my problem-solving abilities.

## Problem Statements

The problem statements are available on HackerRank's website. They cover a diverse range of topics, including string manipulation, array handling, conditionals, loops, and more. Some of the challenges I have solved include:

- [Problem 1](link_to_problem1): Short description of the problem.
- [Problem 2](link_to_problem2): Short description of the problem.
- [Problem 3](link_to_problem3): Short description of the problem.
- ...

## File Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
/
├── problem1/
│   ├── solution.sh
│   ├── test_input.txt
│   └── test_output.txt
├── problem2/
│   ├── solution.sh
│   ├── test_input.txt
│   └── test_output.txt
├── problem3/
│   ├── solution.sh
│   ├── test_input.txt
│   └── test_output.txt
├── ...
├── README.md
└── .gitignore
```

Each problem statement has its own folder containing:
- `solution.sh`: The Bash script containing my solution to the problem.
- `test_input.txt`: Sample input provided by HackerRank for testing the solution.
- `test_output.txt`: Corresponding expected output for the sample input.

## How to Use

To execute any specific solution, you need to have a Bash interpreter installed on your system (which is usually available by default on most Unix-based systems). Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the folder of the problem you want to run the solution for.
3. Open the `solution.sh` file to understand the script.
4. Run the Bash script using the following command:

```bash
bash solution.sh
```

5. If the solution requires input, provide it through standard input (usually by typing manually) or by redirecting the input from the provided test input file:

```bash
bash solution.sh < test_input.txt
```

6. The script will execute, and the output will be displayed on the terminal.

Remember that the provided test inputs and outputs in this repository are just samples. The solutions should handle various cases, including edge cases, for full correctness.
